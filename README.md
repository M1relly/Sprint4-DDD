# Sprint4-DDD
Intended for API-Jersey in Java of Sprint 4 of Challenge-2023 of Porto Seguro.

> The following Restful application is responsible for connecting the Oracle database to JavaScript using the Maven project structure, API-Jersey


## ðŸ–Š Summary about the project
As a response to Porto Seguro Seguros' need to automate the bicycle inspection process, the ProjectP team proposed a solution in which an artificial intelligence, present on a website, recognizes the submitted images of a bike, catalogs its information, stores it in a database and processes the approval or denial of insurance for the vehicle.
This project was designed with the objective of making requests to the database to return survey data in the format of a JSON file to the Front-End produced with Next.js.

## ðŸ’™ About Us
Our team is made up of a group of students (until then - 2023) in the 1st year of the Systems Analysis and Development course.
At our college, each year we receive a Challenge proposed by a company. This year, Porto Seguro Seguros presented the desire to automate the inspection of bicycles (this inspection is a preliminary step for contracting insurance). 
ProjectP sought to present, through this, a relevant and scalable proposal for other types of inspection.


#### âš  NOTE:
This repository contains only the Java application. Other steps for full execution of Project P, such as the front end, are not present.
